Protecting some of the user files like images, financial documents etc are important.Limitations for protecting the personal files and data needs to be eliminated.Encryption and decryption have successfully eliminated the problems associated with sensitive files.Using this application system various files can be encrypted and decrypted by using suitable algorithms.

AES algorithm enables to deal with different key sizes. AES-128 is the most efficient algorithm as 128-bit key length provides sufficient strength today. However, we can implement AES 192, 256 bits key length as well, whereas other encryption algorithms like DES implement only 56-bit key length. Since there is a possibility to implement 192 and 256-bit key length though 128-bit key length is efficient, AES can be considered advantageous over other encryption algorithms.
